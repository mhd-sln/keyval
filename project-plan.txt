- Get (read) from a key. // STATUS: DONE
- Update a key-value by using the PUT. // STATUS: ONGOING

persistant

choose the storage backend. we would need some kind of configuration. ability to change the backend without service restart ?

Questions for the sessions

- should the json file have one key one value or if one key has multiple values then should it be a combo of all the values. Currently its only the latest value
